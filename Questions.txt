Questions

1. I don't think my classes are dependent on one another: Title_Demand_Plan should pull on a Title object, not a string "title"
2. The higher level class should have as a property, something generated by the subclass: Demand Plan should have an available
	forecast generated by subclass Title_Demand_Plan that can be used by the other subclass Title_Returns_Plan

1. How do I get the figures to reset without showing them?
	> Use figure()
	> look into clear function
2. How do I move "generate_presentation.py" to root and import modules correctly?
	> Hacked it
3. What should the class structure look like?
4. Any good way to consolidate functions?
5. Should the plotting be separate from the other class methods, or just pile them all in together?
6. Data structures for plan alternatives?  Should they be classes on their own?
